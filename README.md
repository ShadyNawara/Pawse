A simple utility app for macOS that locks the screen when a cat is detected on the keyboard by checking if at least 3 adjacent keys are pressed simultaneously.

I got my first cat a week ago and have not had a chance to test this extensively, but I knew I had to do something before he “mistakenly” steps his way to a new toy from amazon. I appreciate any willing beta purrticipants.
